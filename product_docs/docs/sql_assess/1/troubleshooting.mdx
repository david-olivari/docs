The EDB SQL Assess tool generates a log file in the same path where the report is generated. The path is provided by the user in the command line options. The tool supports three log levels. If set to `OFF` then log is not generated. If set to `INFO`, which is the default, then all messages are logged except the queries that are assessed. If the level is set to `FINE` then the queries that are assessed are also logged in the file.
