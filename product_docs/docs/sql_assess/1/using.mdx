EDB SQL Assess is a Java-based command line tool that the end user can download and install on their test setup where they can put Oracle in trace mode and run the application. The end user can run a test program or regression test suite that performs most of the possible user actions so that all queries get captured in the trace file. The tool doesn't provide the ability to help put Oracle in trace mode or automatically retrieve the trace file.  The generation and retrieval of the trace file from the server (if different than the machine where the tool is being run) are separate operations performed manually by the user.
