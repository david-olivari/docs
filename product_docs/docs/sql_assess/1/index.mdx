EDB SQL Assess provides the ability to parse Oracle SQL statements and assess their compatibility with EDB Postgres Advanced Server and Java/JDBC API.

## Overview

EDB SQL Assess provides help migrating applications from Oracle to EDB Postgres Advanced Server. It is a command line tool to analyze SQL statements used in the user application for compatibility with EDB Postgres Advanced Server. The tool generates a report that provides the following information:
- A list of incompatible features used in the application SQL statements.
- A list of incompatible queries along with the incompatible feature used in them.
- A list of incompatible queries with suggested repairs that modify the SQL statements in the application when the application is ported from Oracle to EDB Postgres Advanced Server.

The EDB SQL Assess tool expects the user to provide the SQL statements used in the application as an input file in Oracle TRACE file format. There are two options to generate the required input file:

- Put Oracle in trace mode, run the application, and capture the queries run by the application from the TRACE file.
- Run the `edb_query_extractor` SQL script provided by EDB to help capture the SQL statements run by the application from the V$SQL system table.
